MySQL Workbench: Managers Table Queries

Project Overview

This project involves creating a Managers table in MySQL Workbench, inserting data, and executing various queries to retrieve and manipulate data.

Database Setup and Table Creation

Open MySQL Workbench and connect to your database.

Run the following SQL command to create the Managers table:

CREATE TABLE Managers (
    Manager_Id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    First_name VARCHAR(50),
    Last_Name VARCHAR(50),
    DOB DATE,
    Age INT CHECK (Age >= 18),
    Last_update TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    Gender ENUM('Male', 'Female', 'Other'),
    Department VARCHAR(100),
    Salary DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL
);

Data Insertion

Run the following command to insert 10 records into the Managers table:

INSERT INTO Managers (Manager_Id, First_name, Last_Name, DOB, Age, Gender, Department, Salary)
VALUES
(1, 'John', 'Doe', '1980-05-15', 44, 'Male', 'Finance', 30000),
(2, 'Jane', 'Smith', '1992-08-10', 32, 'Female', 'IT', 28000),
(3, 'Robert', 'Brown', '1985-12-20', 39, 'Male', 'HR', 22000),
(4, 'Emily', 'Davis', '1995-06-05', 29, 'Female', 'IT', 26000),
(5, 'Michael', 'Johnson', '1978-04-12', 46, 'Male', 'Sales', 40000),
(6, 'Sarah', 'Williams', '1990-11-30', 34, 'Female', 'Marketing', 25000),
(7, 'David', 'Wilson', '1988-07-18', 36, 'Male', 'IT', 15000),
(8, 'Aaliya', 'Khan', '1993-09-25', 31, 'Female', 'HR', 27000),
(9, 'Kevin', 'Miller', '1982-03-14', 42, 'Male', 'Finance', 32000),
(10, 'Sophia', 'Moore', '1987-01-22', 37, 'Female', 'IT', 29000);

SQL Queries

1. Retrieve Manager's Name and DOB for Manager_Id = 1

SELECT First_name, Last_Name, DOB
FROM Managers
WHERE Manager_Id = 1;

2. Display Annual Income of All Managers

SELECT Manager_Id, First_name, Last_Name, (Salary * 12) AS Annual_Income
FROM Managers;

3. Display All Managers Except 'Aaliya'

SELECT *
FROM Managers
WHERE First_name <> 'Aaliya';

4. Display Managers in IT Department Earning More Than 25000

SELECT *
FROM Managers
WHERE Department = 'IT' AND Salary > 25000;

5. Display Managers Whose Salary is Between 10000 and 35000

SELECT *
FROM Managers
WHERE Salary BETWEEN 10000 AND 35000;

Execution Steps in MySQL Workbench

Open MySQL Workbench and connect to your database.

Copy and paste the CREATE TABLE query and execute it.

Copy and paste the INSERT INTO query and execute it.

Run each of the SQL queries to retrieve data as required.

Expected Outcome

A Managers table will be created with defined constraints.

10 rows of sample data will be inserted.

The queries will return expected results based on the conditions applied.

Conclusion

This project provides a fundamental understanding of SQL queries, constraints, and data retrieval operations in MySQL Workbench.
